# localized charity events aggregator

Developing a scraping API to gather volunteer opportunities worldwide from volunteer websites.

The API aims at providing the opportunities in a clean and consistent way to facilitate volunteer finding opportunities.

A number of organizations and initiatives are already providing such data, however the current work plan is to distribute our functionality to help organizations in other countries or cities scraping data themselves from their local organizations. This will benefit local organizations in need of volunteer as it will facilitate inhabitants to learn about volunteer opportunity.

The scraping API develope in this work is more important that the content itself.
